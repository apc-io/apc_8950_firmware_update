BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING ??MAKE A BACKUP

Don't forget to back up your data. Installing this software will
completely restore APC to the default, factory configuration. 

If you have synced APC with a Google account, then the contacts, 
calendar, Gmail, & select other Google-related data will not be 
lost, these will be restored after the next sync. However, you should 
backup anything you want to keep including:

	- Bookmarks
	- Applications (use Titanium Backup or the Astro File Manager)
	- Any data on your existing microSD card. 


INSTALLATION

1. Copy entire contents of this folder onto
   a blank microSD card (don't use you the same card that 
   you store your data on)

2. Place microSD into APC

3. Restart APC, installation will begin automatically

4. Upon completion, remove microSD card and restart


*Note: 	If you use a VGA connection while updating your APC, your screen will not display the correct information
	making it hard to tell when the system flash is completed. To finish your flash, wait 5 minutes form the time
	you start your update, remove the MicroSD card then restart. This issue will not occur if using an HDMI connection.
